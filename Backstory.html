			<h1>Lineage</h1>
			<p>When Ozai was a baby, a portrait was painted of him while he was playing on a beach.When he was older, he, like his father and grandfather before him, attempted to find and capture the Avatar, but failed as they all did. Unlike his grandfather, father, and brother, Ozai was never a general, and so he has not known great military accomplishments aside from being leader of the Fire Nation later in his life.

            Ozai and his father sought to add Avatar Roku's lineage to the royal family, as the Fire Sages predicted that doing so would yield a more powerful bloodline. The two traveled to Hira'a and tracked down Ursa, the granddaughter of the past Avatar. After a short introduction by his father, Ozai proposed to Ursa and she agreed. However, when they prepared to travel back to the capital city, a commoner blocked their way, demanding to release Ursa. Azulon ordered their bodyguards to deal with him, but after a short struggle, Ursa pleaded with Ozai to call off his soldiers' attack, securing the man's safety, and let her talk to the man to get him to go home. After being called "My Love" by his future wife, the prince complied to the request. After the man was told off, the group continued their journey back to the capital.</p>
			<p>About eight years before Avatar Aang was found in the iceberg, Ozai's older brother Iroh began the six-hundred-day Siege of Ba Sing Se, the Earth Kingdom capital, which ended when Iroh's only son, Lu Ten, died in battle. This led Ozai to request that his father, Fire Lord Azulon, revoke Iroh's birthright as crown prince, allowing Ozai to inherit the throne instead of Iroh. Ozai explained that without an heir, the line of Fire Lords would end with Iroh, while Ozai still had two children. Azulon became furious, refusing to betray his firstborn son's right to the throne. As punishment, Azulon ordered Ozai to kill his own son, Zuko, so he would understand Iroh's pain.

            Ozai's coronation
            Ozai was crowned Fire Lord after the sudden death of his father, Azulon.

            Ozai retreated to his own chambers to wait for Zuko to fall asleep. Ursa pleaded with him to spare Zuko's life, but Ozai countered that he had no choice, since it would be treason to refuse the Fire Lord's command. As a last resort to save Zuko, Ursa offered Ozai what he desired most in exchange for Zuko's life: the Fire Nation throne. She concocted an untraceable color- and odorless poison and turned it over to Ozai to do "whatever [he wished]". Ozai agreed to this on the condition that his wife would leave the palace, believing he too might otherwise be poisoned one day. Ursa tried to take Zuko and Azula with her, but Ozai assured her they would be safe in his hands as long as she kept her word, and threatened to hunt them all down should she try taking their children. Shortly thereafter, Ursa made the poison and turned it over to him, and he sneaked into Azulon's room that same night to end his father's life with it.

            The next morning, Azulon was found dead in his bed. His cremation took place a little later, and while Ozai and his two children were present, the Fire Sages announced Azulon's alleged dying wish; that Ozai would be his successor. The High Sage subsequently crowned the former prince Fire Lord, whereupon those present hailed him as their new ruler and bowed to him.</p>
