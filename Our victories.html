            <h1>Victories</h1>
            <p>As our emenies rally behind a boy we will not sit tight twidlling our thumbs. One of our grander achievvments as of late is the capturing of the so called own breakable ba sing se. Done by our princess Azula she was able to break those from the inside with just her wit and strength turning the weak earth benders agents against themselves.</p>
            <p>But what you want hear is about the avatar. Not only have we found him we have injured him or should I say another achievment for our princess. Dominating the avatar and his rag tag group of friends. Azula was able to shoot lightning through the so called messiah himself. Near death they retreated and left ba sing se t our grasps.</p>
            <p>Not only that but after the injuries the so called messiah has had to have constant healing leaving him incapable of protecting a mere babe. We even have photo evidence of the avatar hurting his own friends out anger for his lost a false messiah.</p>
